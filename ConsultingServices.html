     <h2>Blockchain</h2>
                
                <p>A blockchain is an ever-increasing list of records, called blocks.</p>
                <p>These blocks are linked using cryptography.</p>
            <p>Each block has a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a transaction, and timestamp.</p>
            <p>Blockchain is the technology the underpins digital currencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple.</p>
            <p>Blockchain allows digital info to be distributed, but does not allow it to be copied.</p>
            <p>Each piece of data can only be in the possession of one person.</p>

                <h2>Autonomous Things</h2>
                <p>This is a new term for the technological developments that are expected to bring computers into the physical environment that are without the need for human direction.</p>
                <p>They will be freely-moving and capable of interacting with humans and other objects.</p>
                <p>An example of an autonomous thing is the SGR-A1 sentry gun that was deployed to help South Korean troops protect the Korean Demilitarised Zone.</p>
                <p>It is considered the first unit of its kind to have an integrated system that has voice recognition, surveillance, tracking, and firing.</p>
                <p>An everyday example would be a vacuum cleaner that can navigate around a house autonomously to clean floors.</p>

            <h2>Immersive Experience</h2>
            <p>Immersion into virtual reality is a perception of being present, physically, in a virtual world.</p>
            <p>The perception is created by surrounding the user of the VR system by stimuli that create a convincing environment. </p>
            <p>VR is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as video gaming and 3D cinema.</p>
            <p>is the use of robots that are remotely controlled in dangerous environments such as space.</p>
            <p>In psychology and social sciences, VR offers a cost-effective tool to study and replicate interactions in a controlled environment.</p>
            <p>VR can be used to simulate surgical environments. VR provides cheap and risk-free medical training.</p>
